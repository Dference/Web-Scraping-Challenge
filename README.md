# Web-Scraping-Challenge
## Life on Mars?
For this challenge, I was tasked with a full web-scraping and data analysis project. I have learned to identify HTML elements on a page, identify their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. I have also learned to scrape various types of information that include HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage. To complete the challenge I focused on two objectives: 

Objective 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.

Objective 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

## Rocket Man
The biggest challenge of this was to find the initial class attributes, after that it was all downhill. The weather challenge was pretty straightforward, just taking some new tools, then combining them with Panda skills already acquired.
